Hello there 👋

My name is Elijah Lucian (E-Lie-Jah Loo-Shin) from Calgary, AB, Canada. I'm an experienced self-taught developer with a passion for app development and enterprise solutions. Having honed my skills over the past 17 years, I love to solve big problems with simple systems! A good data model is everything, Rails is life, React is dank! AI is the future.

🔭 I’m currently working on a multitude of projects, transforming business systems into comprehensive Full-Stack solutions, and specializing in React and associated libraries.

🌱 I’m learning VR and AR development in my free time, continually striving to stay on top of modern technologies and development trends.

👯 I’m eager to collaborate on anything that involves generating innovative solutions with code, especially if it involves TypeScript conversions or Server and API design.

🤔 I’m actively seeking help with machine learning, and I believe AI is the future of tech.

💬 Ask me about my idea of a perfect world or my experience with various technologies. I've had the pleasure of working with some impressive clients and projects over the years!

⚡ Fun Fact 1: I wrote a song that won me a year's worth of free beer!
💅 Fun Fact 2: I like to use emojis as commit messages.
🔍 Fun Fact 3: I rebel against the rule of threes.

To see fun projects I am working on, check out [Dank Inc](https://github.com/dankinc)! You can also listen to my [music:](https://linktr.ee/eli7vh).

I have a lot of legacy projects over on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/elijahlucian), where you can see the inner workings of my projects and understand my approach to problem-solving, maybe get inspired? 

For a more comprehensive insight into who I am and what I do, I sporadically post on social media, and my [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/eli7vh) is a great starting point.
